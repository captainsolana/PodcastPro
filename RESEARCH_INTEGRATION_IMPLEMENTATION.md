- **Future Implications**: Forward-looking insights and predictions

## 🔄 Enhanced Workflow

### Before (Basic Script Generation)
```
Research Data → Generic Script Prompt → Basic Script Output (~20% research utilization)
```

### After (Enhanced Research Integration)
```
Research Data → Intelligent Extraction → Structured Categories → 
Domain-Aware Templates → Expert Script Generation → Utilization Metrics
(Target: 60-80% research utilization)
```

## 📊 New Output Structure

Enhanced `ScriptResult` now includes:

```typescript
interface ScriptResult {
  content: string;                    // Enhanced script content
  sections: Array<...>;              // Structured sections
  totalDuration: number;             // Timing information
  analytics: {...};                  // Basic analytics
  researchUtilization?: {            // NEW: Research usage metrics
    dataPointsUsed: number;
    totalDataPoints: number;
    utilizationRate: number;         // Percentage of research used
    narrativeElements: string[];     // Stories and narratives used
    evidenceElements: string[];      // Statistics and expert insights used
    engagementElements: string[];    // Quotes and surprising facts used
  };
  qualityMetrics?: {                 // NEW: Content quality assessment
    contentDepth: number;            // Depth of content coverage
    expertiseLevel: number;          // Level of domain expertise
    audienceAlignment: number;       // Audience appropriateness
    narrativeFlow: number;           // Script flow quality
  };
}
```

## 🎯 Domain-Aware Script Templates

### Integration with Existing Domain Expertise

The enhanced script generation leverages our existing domain analysis:

#### Fintech Scripts
- **Structure**: Problem → Innovation → Technical Implementation → Market Impact → Future Evolution
- **Research Focus**: Regulatory context, adoption statistics, technical architecture, market dynamics
- **Example Elements**: UPI adoption rates, regulatory milestones, technical infrastructure details

#### Healthcare Scripts  
- **Structure**: Health Challenge → Innovation → Clinical Evidence → Patient Impact → System Integration
- **Research Focus**: Clinical studies, patient outcomes, regulatory approvals, accessibility metrics
- **Example Elements**: Patient testimonials, clinical trial results, healthcare system data

#### Technology Scripts
- **Structure**: Technical Challenge → Innovation → Implementation → Adoption → Transformation → Future
- **Research Focus**: Technical specifications, adoption patterns, industry transformation metrics
- **Example Elements**: Performance benchmarks, adoption timelines, industry impact data

## 🚀 Research Utilization Enhancement
